## OSF Preprints Style Preview
Chrome Extension that helps preview different styles on the Open Science Framework preprint pages.

### Known quirks/issues:
- If you leave the page or click out of the style preview popup, it clears your color selections.
- When choosing colors, you must click the larger color panel on the left before you can choose a color from the rainbow selector on the right.

### TODO:
 - Reimplement ability to upload logos and banners
